	<h1>Assignment 2.3 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
	<h2>Chapter 1: Gibberish About Myself</h2>
	<p id="intro"> My name is Joshua Rex, and I am a programming student in Belleuvue University. 
	I am studying Programming due to an interest in technology, and to have knowledge that can bring
	a decent income while I continue to pursue things that pay less but I am passionate about. One of those
	things is teaching.</p>
	<p>I start teaching at a Classical Christian School this week. I have spent over ten years in
	youth ministry, but did not feel that the few hours I got a week with the kids was enough.
	The pressures they face in school is the atmosphere they breathe, and to make a real difference
	I wanted to be more involved.</p>
	<p> There are a number of things that I think are wrong with our current education system. For one
	thing, its focus feels utilitarian. The student jumps through hoops, with little interest or retention. 
	By doing so they earn a certain amount of social captial or credit that they can turn in for a better paying 
	job later down the line.</p>
	<p>In all honesty, that is what my college experience has felt like at Bellevue. Even the paragraphs
	I type here seem like a certain amount of busy work that do not relate to what I actually need to learn. I could
	study the majority of these topics more effectively with free or low cost resources. As a student, it feels
	frustrating. <span class='sentence'>My headmaster where I am about to teach believes the point of education is moral formation, 
	and that is part of what inspires me.</span> Especially given the state I see young men in society now, teaching them to 
	be good feels more important than teaching them to be profitable or to check boxes saying they have studied something. 
	We ought to learn to make something apart of ourselves, to grow to be better, or to create new joy in the world.</p>
